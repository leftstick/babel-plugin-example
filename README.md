# example

Let's try to create a babel plugin, we are going to add new operator -> not equal sign with `^` with this plugin.

See following example:

Transform `console.log('userA' ^ 'userB')` into `console.log('userA' !== 'userB')`

## install dependencies

```
yarn
```

## check demo

```
yarn build
```
